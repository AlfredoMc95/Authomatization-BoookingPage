# Selenium Automation Project

## Project Overview
This project automates the process of navigating a booking website using Selenium. The automation performs a series of actions including changing the currency, searching by country, selecting check-in and check-out dates, filtering by rating (4 and 5 stars), and returning the results in a tabular format.

## Features
- **Open the Web Page**: Automatically navigates to the specified website.
- **Change Currency**: Changes the currency displayed on the website.
- **Search by Country**: Performs a search for accommodations/services in a specified country.
- **Select Check-in and Check-out Dates**: Inputs the desired check-in and check-out dates.
- **Filter by Star Rating**: Filters the results to show only 4 and 5-star options.
- **Return Results**: Extracts the filtered results and displays them in a tabular format (CSV or other).
